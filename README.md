BuzzBoards
==========

FortiTo‘s BuzzBoards™ educational technology system is based on a series of pluggable hardware and software modules, which can be assembled in different combinations, determining both the functionality and physical form, to create a variety of electronic prototypes.

These drivers (developed in Phyton) use the I2C protocol to add sensors and actuators to the Raspberry Pi through a hub base board (BuzzBerry).
